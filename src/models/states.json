Today, the castle stands as a partially finished relic, with its abandoned hallways, grand arches, and rooftop offering panoramic views of the surrounding landscape.\n\nOne of the most fascinating features of Kellie's Castle is its connection to various legends and ghost stories, making it a popular destination for tourists and history enthusiasts alike.
